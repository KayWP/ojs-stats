    **Abstract Views** measure **initial interest**:
    - Recorded when someone visits the article's landing page
    - Shows the article title, authors, abstract, and keywords
    - Indicates browsing behavior and topic relevance
    - Higher abstract views suggest good discoverability (SEO, keywords, titles)
    
    **File Downloads** measure **deeper engagement**:
    - Recorded when someone opens the PDF or file viewer
    - Indicates serious intent to read or reference the article
    - Generally represents higher-value interactions
    - Downloads may be accessed directly via Google or bookmarks, bypassing the abstract page
    
    **Interpreting the Comparison**:
    - **Downloads > Abstract Views**: Readers are finding your content directly (good SEO, direct links)
    - **Abstract Views > Downloads**: Normal pattern showing browsing vs. committed reading
    - **High Abstract, Low Downloads**: May indicate titles/abstracts are appealing but content doesn't match expectations

        st.markdown("""
        **What is an Abstract View?**
    
        An abstract view is recorded when someone looks at the article landing page which gives an overview of the article. 
        This measures initial interest in your content. Note that reloading or refreshing the landing page will also add 
        an abstract view - these are not unique visitors.
        
        **What is a File Download?**
        
        A file download is recorded when someone opens a file by clicking the relevant button to enter the file or PDF viewer. 
        It represents deeper engagement with your content. Note: it doesn't track whether the file is actually saved to 
        someone's computer.            

        **Do Bots influence these statistics?**
    
        OJS uses COUNTER-recommended methods to filter out automated activity:
        - Known bot and crawler filtering using COUNTER lists
        - Consolidating multiple views from the same user within 30 seconds into a single view
        - This means your statistics may be lower than raw server logs, but more accurate for real readership
                          
        **Do deleted submissions affect my statistics?**
        
        OJS does not count properly deleted submissions in statistics. However, if your numbers seem off, check for:
        - Duplicate submissions where only one version was published
        - Submissions that were rejected but not properly deleted
        - Multiple versions of the same manuscript
